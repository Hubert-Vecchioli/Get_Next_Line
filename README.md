Program that reads the next line from a file. (Using it on the same file multiple times allows you to read until the end of the file.)

Compile `get_next_line.c` and `get_next_line_utils.c` to print the first line of the file provided (relative path) in the main function of `get_next_line.c`. Compile with `get_next_line_bonus.c` and `get_next_line_utils_bonus.c` to print lines from multiple files simultaneously.

Add the `-D BUFFER_SIZE=n` flag during compilation to modify the buffer size used by the read function to n. (The default buffer size is 42.)
